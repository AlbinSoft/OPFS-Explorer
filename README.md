# OPFS Explorer

This application will let you explore the OPFS (Origin Private File System) in a similar way that Dropbox lets you browse your cloud files.

## Instaling

Just drop the files on a folder on the server in the same way you will upload and access the phpMyAdmin.

## ToDo

Many many things

* Improve responsive.
* Configuration panel.
* Bug: search dialog is not shown.
* Rename simulation, because there is no API to move or rename a file. Under the hood it will be the read, write and remove secuence.

## Why preact?

Short answer: no need of development settup.

Preact gives you the benefits of a reactive user interface without burdening you with transpilers. You can edit my code in your favorite text editor, save it and (hopefully) your change will take effect. So easy.
