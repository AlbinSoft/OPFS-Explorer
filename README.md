# OPFS Explorer

This application will let you explore the OPFS (Origin Private File System) in a similar way that Dropbox lets you browse your cloud files.

## Installing

Just drop the files on a folder on the server in the same way you will upload and access the phpMyAdmin.

## ToDo

Many many things

* Improve responsive.
* Improve action icons.
* Configuration panel.
* Rename simulation, because there is no API to move or rename a file. Under the hood it will be a read, write and remove secuence.

## Why have I choose preact?

Short answer: no need of development setup.

Preact gives you the benefits of a reactive user interface without burdening you with transpilers. You can edit my code in your favorite text editor, save it and (hopefully) your change will take effect. So easy.

## Vanity block

This project was boosted while I spent a weekend in Dénia, Alicante, Spain.

There is an extension for Chrome which also lets you [explore OPFS](https://github.com/tomayac/opfs-explorer) inside the DevTools
